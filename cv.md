I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. Immediately after graduation I decided to get my Master's in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver and graduated in 2017.

A data scientist, as they say, is one part computer scientist, one part mathematician, and one part statistician. This was ingrained in me in 2012 by my professor/advisor. Because of this, the technical papers and blogs that I read span from data management and warehousing to 'bleeding edge' deep learning papers. I must admit that I really enjoy hashing out the details of implementing a new deep learning model. It is also very satisfying to manage and own a package people use on a regular basis for handling data. 

I __currently__ work for TruU Inc. in Boulder, Colorado. As a deep learning scientist, my role here is diverse. One of the biggest goals is building robust models for out of distribution detection. Another critical task is crafting latent spaces where euclidean distance indicates class membership. I have also implemented papers such as *ArcFace*, *Outrageously Large Neural Networks*, *Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization*, etc. Additionally, I help to support other data scientists as an owner of a dataset package used to train on data too large to fit into memory. 

In the __past__, I worked at NREL as a data scientist. My role there was to characterize fleets of vehicles. The data was a few Tbs of time series data from the vehicle's onboard sensors. Characterizing these fleets of vehicles included a lot of feature vector design, cluster analysis and visualization, not to mention a lot of data management. I often presented my results to other NREL employees and with our partners at the EPA. Additionally, I spend time with the engineers on our team to determine the best way to extract, transform and load our data. We used PySpark for this ETL process and it allowed engineers to test different transforms specific to their engineering problem.
