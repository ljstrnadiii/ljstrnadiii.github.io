I have been familiarizing myself with Machine Learning Algorithms since I have been in undergrad. I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. I wanted to strengthen my education in Statistics, so I decided to get my Master's in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver and graduated in 2017.

As a practicing Data Scientist, I work with PostgreSQL, migrate terabytes of messy csvs into Spark, build Docker containers for Deep Learning to train and perform inference on AWS/GCP, build convolutional neural networks for classification, build LSTM models to predict time series data, have replicated results of a deep learning paper to predict ancestry with genomic data, perform Bayesian parameter estimation, present data summaries and data visualization to the EPA on a regular basis, visualize clustering of high dimensional data with t-SNE, carefully craft feature spaces, Et cetera ... 

I typically work with Python packages such as __tensorflow__, __pandas__, __sklearn__, __psycopg2__, __pyspark.sql__, __seaborn__, among others.

Context matters, but at the core of most things are vector spaces! At this point in my life, I am excited to work in any context that allows me to exercise machine learning and big data methods. I have used third party packages to handle high dimensional genomic data, regularly work with time series data from fleets of vehicles, image data, inventory data, electric vehicle charging data, among others.

I have recently taken ownership of NREL's machine learning efforts on [Fleet DNA](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/fleettest-fleet-dna.html) and have big ideas.
