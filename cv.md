I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. Immediately after graduation I decided to get my Master's in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver and graduated in 2017.

A data scientist, as they say, is one part computer scientist, one part mathematician, and one part statistician. This was ingrained in me in 2012 by my professor/advisor. Because of this, the technical papers and blogs that I read span from data management and warehousing to 'bleeding edge' deep learning papers. I must admit that I really enjoy hashing out the details of implementing a new deep learning model. It is also very satisfying to manage and own a package people use on a regular basis for handling data.
