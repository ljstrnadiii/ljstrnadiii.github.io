I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics and then my Master's in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver.

A data scientist, as they say, is one part computer scientist, one part mathematician, and one part statistician. My experience over the past few years includes topics such as approximate nearest neighbor search; deep learning for embedding, prediction, classification; bayesian methods for parameter estimation; data pipelining for training, etc. 

I __currently__ work for [Pex](www.pex.com) in Boulder, Colorado. As a machine learning scientist, my role here is diverse. We process an insane amount of data. The machine learning team often has very special constraints to meet in order to take models into production. 

I have implemented papers such as *ArcFace*, *Outrageously Large Neural Networks*, *Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization*, among others. I also have experience supporting other data scientists as an owner of a repository. 

This is my second startup experience. Previously, I worked at TruU Inc and NREL as a data scientist. My role at NREL was to characterize fleets of vehicles. The data was a few Tbs of time series data from the vehicle's onboard sensors. Characterizing these fleets of vehicles included a lot of feature vector design, cluster analysis and visualization, not to mention a lot of data management. I often presented my results to other NREL employees and with our partners at the EPA. Additionally, I spend time with the engineers on our team to determine the best way to extract, transform and load our data.

# Projects
