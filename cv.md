I have been familiarizing myself with Machine Learning Algorithms since I have been in undergrad circa 2012. I earned my undergrgad in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. I decided to pursue more Statistics and earned my M.S. in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver.

As a practicing Data Scientist, I work with PostgreSQL, have scraped the web for data, migrated terabytes of inconsistent csvs into Spark, built Docker containers for Deep Learning training and inference on AWS, leveraged transfer learning, built convolutional neural networks for classification, replicated results of a deep learning model to predict ancestry with genomic data, regularly present data summaries and visualization to the EPA, visualize clustering of high dimensional, carefully crafted feature spaces with t-SNE, Et cetera ...

Context matters, but at the core of most things are vectors! I have used third party packages to handle genomic data in high dimension, regularly work with time series data from fleets of vehicles, worked with image data, inventory data, electric vehicle charging data, captured schemas from millions of csvs to upload to Spark in a consistent fashion, Et cetera .... I enjoy working in different contexts, but am exceptionally motivated to take part adding efficiency.
