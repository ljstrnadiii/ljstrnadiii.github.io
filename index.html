<p>
Hey there, thanks for visiting. I am a Cleveland, Ohio native and live in Boulder, Colorado. My weekday life is centered around data and my weekend life is centered around mountains. 
</p>

<p>
I am currently a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> at Pex focusing on applying machine learning to media data across many social media platforms. I earned my Master's in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver and undergraduate degree in Mathematics.
I use PyTorch and TensorFlow to build neural networks, Python and PySpark to process, clean and load data, Pandas/Sklearn for routine data analysis, and Faiss for approximate nearest neighbor methods.
</p>

<p>
On the weekends I try to maximize time in the mountains: <strong>running</strong>, mountain biking, bike touring, skiing, climbing or scrambling.
