<p>
Hey there, thanks for visiting. This website is here to help you become more familiar with my career and interests. I am a Cleveland, Ohio native and live in Boulder, Colorado. My weekday life is centered around data and my weekend life is centered around mountains. 
</p>

<p>
I am currently a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> at TruU Inc. focusing on prediction and user verification using deep learning methods. I earned my Master's in Statistics from the University of Colorado at Denver and undergraduate degree in Mathematics.
I use PyTorch and TensorFlow to build neural networks, Python and PySpark to process, clean and load data, and Pandas/Sklearn for routine data analysis. I am most interested in representation learning, prediction and clustering.
</p>

<p>
On weekends, I try to eliminate screen time and maximize mountain time: <strong>running</strong>, mountain biking, bike touring, climbing or scrambling.
