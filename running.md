# Trail Running

Trail running is at the center of all my weekend plans. It continues to refresh my appreciation for the greatest, most tangible thing we have--the wilderness. Endurance activities have taught me to be patient, which has permeated all other areas of my life.

I occasionally race. Check out my UltraSignup [here](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Leonard&lname=Strnad).

Colorado has so much to offer and I could not be more stoked to live here.
